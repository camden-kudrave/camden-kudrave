# Camden Kudrave - Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm Camden Kudrave, and I'm passionate about leveraging data to uncover meaningful insights and drive decision-making processes. As I embark on my journey into the world of data analysis, this GitHub page serves as a portfolio of my projects and endeavors.

## About Me

I come from a background in the hospitality industry, having spent over four years as a bartender. While the fast-paced environment of the restaurant world has honed my multitasking and customer service skills, I've discovered my true passion lies in the realm of data. Over the past six months, I've dedicated myself to studying data analysis, focusing on sharpening my skills in Python, R, SQL, and Tableau.

## Portfolio Highlights

Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, ranging from exploratory data analysis to predictive modeling and visualization. Each project represents a step forward in my journey, showcasing my ability to extract actionable insights from raw data and communicate findings effectively.

## Current Focus

I am actively seeking my first role in data analysis, eager to apply my skills in a professional setting. As I continue to learn and grow, I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate with like-minded individuals and contribute to projects that make a real-world impact.
